Happy to see you (again?) @ `apporz.com` which is my personal website.

I'm `Micooz`, a front-end engineer as well as an ACGer.

On my way to become `fullstack engineer`, I'm seeking into morden technologies, open source projects,
tools and blogs, and create amazing things.

It is no exaggeration to say that I'm using the tools and technologies of the next generation in web development.

## Where I am?

I'm active in [github](https://github.com/micooz). There are lot's of repositories I made/contributing,
feel free to give a star or fork if you like.

Also you can find me through links under this page.

For more details about this site, please refer to [acknowledgements](/acknowledgements).

**Motto**

pursue `simple`, `efficient` and `perfect`.
